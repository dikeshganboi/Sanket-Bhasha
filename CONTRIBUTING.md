## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some modifications:

```python
# Good
def process_text(input_text, language_code):
    """
    Process input text for translation.

    Args:
        input_text (str): The text to process
        language_code (str): Language code (e.g., 'hi', 'en')

    Returns:
        str: Processed text
    """
    cleaned_text = input_text.strip()
    return cleaned_text

# Use descriptive variable names
user_input = request.POST.get('sen')
detected_language = detect_language(user_input)

# Add type hints where possible
def translate_text(text: str, target_lang: str = 'en') -> str:
    pass
```

## Adding New Languages

To add support for a new language:

1. **Update `translation_service.py`**:

```python
SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = {
    'ur': {  # Urdu example
        'name': 'Urdu',
        'code': 'ur',
        'speech_code': 'ur-PK',
        'native_name': 'Ø§Ø±Ø¯Ùˆ',
        'flag': 'ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°',
        'active': True
    }
}
```

2. **Update frontend placeholders** in `templates/animation.html`:

```javascript
const placeholderMap = {
  ur: "Ø§Ù¾Ù†Ø§ Ù¾ÛŒØºØ§Ù… Ù¹Ø§Ø¦Ù¾ Ú©Ø±ÛŒÚº...",
  // ...
};
```

3. **Add speech recognition mapping**:

```javascript
const languageMap = {
  ur: "ur-PK",
  // ...
};
```

4. **Add TTS mapping**:

```javascript
const ttsLanguageMap = {
  ur: "ur-PK",
  // ...
};
```

5. **Test thoroughly**:

```bash
pytest tests/test_multilingual.py
```

6. **Update documentation** in README.md

   - File naming: `{word}.mp4` (lowercase)

2. **Place video** in `static/` directory

3. **Update word mapping** if needed in `views.py`

4. **Test playback** in the application
